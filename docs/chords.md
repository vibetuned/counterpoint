1. The Pivot RuleA pivot chord is a chord that exists in both your "Old Key" and your "New Key."Example: $A$ minor is the $vi$ chord in C Major, but it is also the $ii$ chord in G Major.Logic: Tell the generator: “If you hit $A$ minor, you are allowed to switch the 'Key Variable' to G Major.” Suddenly, your fingering practice includes $F\#$ instead of $F$ natural.

2. The "Tonicization" Rule (Secondary Dominants)This is the quickest way to spice up fingering. For any chord in your progression, play the $V$ chord of that chord first.If you are going to $D$ minor ($ii$), play an $A$ Major chord ($V$ of $ii$) before it.This forces the generator to use a $C\#$ even though you are technically in C Major. It breaks the "all-white-key" habit and makes your fingers work harder.

3. In the Bach style, try changing chords every two beats. This creates a high "harmonic rhythm" that is excellent for training quick reflex transitions in the left hand.

4. The Inversion Rule: "The 3-Note Limit"For training fingering, the most important logic for inversions isn't comfort—it's Voice Leading.The Logic: When moving from Chord A to Chord B, the individual notes (voices) should move the smallest distance possible (usually a step or a skip).The Rule: If your generator picks a new chord, have it calculate which inversion puts the notes closest to the previous chord's notes.Example: Moving from C Major (C-E-G) to F Major. Don't jump to F-A-C. Use C-F-A (2nd inversion). This keeps the "C" stationary and trains your fingers to expand and contract rather than just "hopping."

5. Seventh Chords (The "Tension Motor")In Baroque music, 7ths aren't just for flavor; they provide the "pull" to the next chord.Major 7th ($I^{maj7}$): Use it on the $I$ or $IV$ for a "dreamy" feel.Dominant 7th ($V^7$): Mandatory logic. If your generator picks a $V$ chord, give it a 50% chance to become a $V^7$.The Finger Rule: The 7th of the chord (e.g., the $F$ in a $G^7$ chord) must resolve downward by a half-step in the next chord (to the $E$ in $C$ Major).

6. Suspensions ($Sus$ Chords)Sus chords are the "heartbreak" of Baroque music. They create a "delay" in the resolution.$Sus4$ Logic: Replace the 3rd of a chord with the 4th, then "resolve" it back to the 3rd in the next beat.The Training Benefit: This is great for independent finger strength (e.g., holding the 4th finger down while others move).

7. Diminished and Augmented (The "Transitions")These are "unstable" chords. They should never be the destination, only the bridge.Diminished ($vii^\circ$): Use this as a substitute for $V$. It creates a "tighter" tension.Augmented ($+$): Best used on the $V$ chord. The raised 5th acts as a "super-leading-tone" that wants to resolve upward to the 3rd of the $I$ chord.Example: $G-B-D\# \rightarrow C-E-G$.

8. Extended & Altered Chords (The "Jazz/Modern" Twist)If you add $9ths$, $11ths$, or $13ths$, the Baroque logic will start sounding like Jazz or Impressionism (Debussy).Add9: Excellent for Einaudi-style arpeggios. Adding the 2nd (the 9th) to a major chord ($1-2-3-5$) creates a rich, open sound that is very comfortable for the hand's natural span.Altered Chords ($b5, \#9$): Use these only on the $V$ chord and only if the next chord is the $I$. They create maximum dissonance that makes the resolution feel incredibly satisfying.

9. Bass Movement Rule: The bass note (root or inversion) should generally move by step, 4th, or 5th to create smooth bass lines - essential for training left hand coordination.

10. Cadence Patterns: Include standard cadences (V-I, IV-I, ii-V-I) to train the common resolution patterns.

11. Rhythmic Variation: For the arpeggiated version, vary the arpeggio patterns (ascending, descending, broken, alberti bass style).

12. Position Shift Rule: After N chords in the same register, force a position change to train smooth positional shifts.
