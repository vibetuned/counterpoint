[cite_start]| [cite: 349, 350, 370] |
| 6 | Finger Strength/Agility | [cite_start]**Weak-Finger Rule**: Penalty for using fingers considered less strong and agile (fingers 4 and 5)[cite: 419, 420]. | [cite_start]1 point for every use of finger 4 or finger 5[cite: 419]. [cite_start]| [cite: 419, 420] |
| 7 | Finger Strength/Agility | [cite_start]**Three-Four-Five Rule**: Penalty for using fingers 3, 4, and 5 consecutively, which are difficult to coordinate on the weak side of the hand[cite: 421, 422]. | [cite_start]1 point per occurrence of the sequence 3-4-5 (in any order)[cite: 421]. [cite_start]| [cite: 421, 422] |
| 8 | Finger Strength/Agility | [cite_start]**Three-to-Four Rule**: Penalty for following finger 3 immediately with finger 4, a difficult transition due to tendon limitations[cite: 440, 442]. | [cite_start]1 point per occurrence[cite: 440]. [cite_start]| [cite: 440, 442] |
| 9 | Finger Strength/Agility | [cite_start]**Four-on-Black Rule**: Penalty for a consecutive transition between fingers 3 and 4 where finger 3 is on white and finger 4 is on black[cite: 441, 444]. | [cite_start]1 point per occurrence (in either order)[cite: 441]. [cite_start]| [cite: 441, 444] |
| 10 | Black and White Keys | [cite_start]**Thumb-on-Black Rule**: Penalty for placing the thumb on a black key, which can displace the hand from a comfortable position[cite: 448, 468]. | [cite_start]1 base point + 2 points if the preceding note is white + 2 points if the following note is white[cite: 448, 449, 450]. [cite_start]| [cite: 448, 449, 450, 468] |
| 11 | Black and White Keys | [cite_start]**Five-on-Black Rule**: Penalty for placing the little finger on a black key when surrounded by white keys[cite: 451, 468]. | [cite_start]2 points if the preceding note is white + 2 points if the following note is white (0 points if both neighbors are black)[cite: 451, 452, 453].

| 12 | Black and White Keys | [cite_start]**Thumb-Passing Rule**: Penalty based on the difficulty of passing the thumb under/over another finger relative to key elevation[cite: 493, 494]. | 1 point for passes on the same level; [cite_start]3 points for white-to-black passes involving the thumb[cite: 493].
